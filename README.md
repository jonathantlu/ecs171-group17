## Project Description
Classifying Diabetes Risk by Various Influences with Regression Models
## Problem Statement
  This project will analyze the CDC diabetes dataset to classify patients as high or low risk for having or developing diabetes.
A more accurate prediction can improve the care and prevention of diabetes.    
  The output of the model will be a binary classification of whether the patient is at risk for diabetes given information from their medical information, lifestyle, and demographics.

## Dataset Description
250k patient records with 22 attributes such as demographics, vital signs, diagnoses, and lifestyle factors.

## Feature Engineering: 
- Using correlation analysis to select key variables.     
- Logistic regression → L1/L2 regularization to prevent overfitting    
- SVM → using k-fold cross-validation    
- Binary classification    


## Goal
- Explore the correlation between lifestyle and diabetes in the US    
- Identify key variables that influence the risk of developing or worsening diabetes    
- Train and evaluate multiple regression/classification models    
- Assess performances and choose the best model based on accuracy metrics    
- Make predictions on a test set and submit results    

## Timeline (Across 8 week period; project is due 12/01):
Week 1: Confirm the topic, discuss scheduling, give roles, outline the proposal    
Week 2: Data exploration and cleaning and finding more relevant data if needed    
Week 3: Feature engineering and model developing    
Week 4: Model testing, training, and selection    
Week 5: Finalize model, make predictions, and write report rough draft    
Week 6: Work on the report, prepare the presentation    
Week 7: Finalize report and begin poster-making    
Week 8: Finish poster making and presentation → submit
